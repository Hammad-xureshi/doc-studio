It means focusing on the speaker\u2019s words, feelings, and message instead of just waiting to reply. Good listening requires attention, patience, and an open mind. Barriers to Listening\n1. Distractions: Noise, phone notifications, or other people talking can break concentration.\n2. Lack of Focus: Daydreaming or thinking about something else while someone is speaking.\n3. Prejudice or Bias: Judging the speaker\u2019s appearance, accent, or opinion before listening.\n4. Interrupting: Cutting the speaker off to give your own thoughts.\n5. Language Problems: Not understanding the words or vocabulary being used.\n6. Emotional Reactions: Getting angry or upset instead of calmly listening.\n\n[Page 9]\nWAYS TO REMOVE BARRIERS\nTo become a better listener, you can:\n1. Stay Focused: Give full attention to the speaker and avoid multitasking.\n2. Reduce Distractions: Turn off phones, lower background noise, and maintain eye\ncontact.\n3. Be Open -Minded: Listen without judging or forming an opinion too quickly.\n4. Wait Before Responding: Allow the speaker to finish before you reply.\n5. Ask Questions: If something is unclear, politely ask for clarification.\n6. Practice Active Listening: Nod, use facial expressions, or repeat key points to show\nunderstanding.\n\n[Page 10]\nACTIVE LISTENING\nActive listening is a way of listening where you give full attention to the speaker and\nshow that you truly understand their message. It is more than just hearing words \u2014it\nmeans focusing on the speaker\u2019s feelings, asking questions, and giving feedback to show\ninterest. Key Features of Active Listening:\n1. Full Attention: Looking at the speaker and avoiding distractions like phones or side\nconversations.\n2. Understanding: Trying to catch both the meaning and emotions behind the words.\n3. Feedback: Nodding, smiling, or saying small words like \u201cI see\u201d or \u201cThat makes\nsense\u201d to show you are following.\n4. Clarification: Asking questions or repeating key points to make sure you understood\ncorrectly.\n5. Non-Judgment: Listening without interrupting or criticizing the speaker.\n\n[Page 11]\nActive Listening comprises of the following:\n\u27a2Stop talking and start listening\n\u27a2Focus attention on Speaker & avoid any distraction\n\u27a2Maintain eye -contact\n\u27a2Listen for central ideas\n\u27a2Establish Rapport.\n\u27a2Check your emotions to avoid any bias\n\u27a2Concentrate on what the Speaker is saying. Focus your attention on key points,\nconcepts, and feelings displayed in the message.\n\n[Page 12]\n\u27a2Suspend your judgements and avoid jumping to conclusion without first listening the\nspeaker fully.\n\u27a2Listen for the main points, key ideas and important messages.\n\u27a2Look for areas of interest, and agreement. If you have to disagree agreeably by\ncriticizing the ideas but not the speaker.\n\u27a2Do not jump to the conclusion.\n\u27a2Ask questions for clarification.\n\u27a2Summarize what you understand, what is other person is saying.\n\u27a2Take notes to remember what is said.\n\n[Page 13]\nPROCESS OF LISTENING\nListening is an active process through which we receive, understand, interpret, and\nrespond to spoken messages. It involves both hearing and understanding what is said. The process of listening can be divided into five main stages :\n1. Receiving (Hearing)\n\u27a2This is the first stage , where the listener hears the sound of the speaker\u2019s words.\n\u27a2It involves paying attention and recognizing the sounds, tone, and pitch of the\nmessage. Example: You hear your teacher explaining a topic in class.\n\n[Page 14]\n2. Understanding (Comprehending)\n\u27a2At this stage, the listener tries to understand the meaning of the words or message.\n\u27a2It involves interpreting vocabulary, grammar, and context to make sense of what is heard. Example: You understand what your teacher means when she says, \u201cThe test will be on Friday.\u201d\n3. Evaluating (Interpreting or Judging)\n\u27a2Here, the listener analyzes and judges the message.\n\u27a2You decide whether the message is true, logical, or important. Example: You think about whether the information your friend gave you is correct or not.\n\n[Page 15]\n4. Responding (Reacting)\n\u27a2After understanding and evaluating, the listener gives feedback \u2014either verbally or\nnonverbally.\n\u27a2This can be a nod, smile, question, or spoken reply. Example: You nod in agreement or say, \u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\n5. Remembering (Retaining)\n\u27a2The final stage is storing the information in memory for future use.\n\u27a2Good listeners remember important details from the conversation. Example: You recall your teacher\u2019s instructions when preparing for the test.\n\n[Page 16]\nTYPES OF LISTENING\n1. Active Listening\nFocusing completely on the speaker, understanding the message, and responding\nthoughtfully. Example: A student paying attention to a teacher\u2019s lecture, taking notes, and asking\nquestions.\n2. Passive Listening\nHearing the words but not giving full attention or feedback. Example: Listening to background music while doing homework.\n3. Critical Listening\nListening carefully to evaluate or judge what is being said. Example: Listening to a politician\u2019s speech to decide whether to support their ideas.\n\n[Page 17]\nCONTINUE\n5. Appreciative Listening\nListening for enjoyment or pleasure. Example: Enjoying a favorite song, a poem recital, or a storytelling session.\n6. Selective Listening\nHearing only parts of the message that interest you and ignoring the rest. Example: A child listening only when their parent mentions \u201cchocolate\u201d\nduring a long talk.\n\n[Page 18]\nREADING SKILL\n1. Reading skill is the ability to recognize, understand, and interpret written words\nand sentences to get meaning from a text.\n2. Reading skill means the process of decoding written symbols to understand ideas,\ninformation, and emotions expressed by the writer.\n3. Reading skill is the process of getting meaning from written or printed text\nthrough understanding words, sentences, and ideas.\n4. Reading skill refers to the capacity to interpret and analyze written language\neffectively for learning and communication.\n\n[Page 19]\nTECHNIQUES OF READING/ TYPES\nReading techniques are methods or strategies that help readers understand, analyze, and remember what\nthey read. The main techniques of reading are:\n1. Skimming\nDefinition:\nSkimming means reading quickly to get the main idea or general overview of a text without focusing on\nevery word. Purpose:\nIt helps to understand the overall theme or central idea of a passage quickly. How to Do It:\n\u27a2Read the title, headings, and subheadings .\n\u27a2Look at the first and last sentences of paragraphs.\n\u27a2Notice key words , dates, or names. Example:\nWhen you pick up a newspaper article, you may skim it to know what it\u2019s about \u2014for example, \u201cThe\narticle talks about climate change in Pakistan.\u201d\n\n[Page 20]\n2. Scanning\nDefinition:\nScanning means reading quickly to find specific information or details such as\nnumbers, names, or dates.

Nonverbal communication refers to the ways in which beings convey information about their emotions, needs, intentions, attitudes, and thoughts without the use of verbal language. NVC often reveals our true feelings and intentions more than words do. Agar koi kehta hai \u201cMain theek hoon\u201d lekin uska chehra udaas ho, awaaz dukhi ho, to uski body language asal jazbaat bata deti hai ke wo theek nahi ha\n\n. NVC is crucial across all cultures, encouraging positive interactions and understanding. Agar do log alag mulkon se milte hain aur ek doosre ki zubaan nahi samajhte, phir bhi muskurahat, aankhon ka contact, ya haath milana jaise gestures se unke darmiyan positive connection ban jata hai\n\n[Slide 3]\n\nDefining the Channels of Communication\n\nNon-verbal communication uses silent signals to interact with the world. Non-verbal communication mein hum bolte nahi, balkay muskurahat, aankhon ka contact, ya body language se apni feelings dikhate hain\n\nIntentional Signals\n\nConscious actions like waving goodbye or nodding in agreement. Jese kisi ko haath hila ke \u201cbye\u201d kehna ya sar hila ke \u201chaan\u201d kehna\n\nUnintentional Cues\n\nSubconscious signals, such as crossing arms when nervous or a tense facial expression when stressed. Subconscious signals wo hote hain jo hum bina soche samjhe dikhate hain, jaise nervous hone par arms cross karna aur stress mein tense chehra. Context is Key\n\nHow NVC is understood depends on the situation, like a hug being appropriate in one setting but not another. NVC ko samajhna situation par depend karta hai; jaise funeral mein muskurana inappropriate hoga, lekin birthday party ya celebration mein muskurana bilkul theek aur natural hai.\n\n[Slide 4]\n\nThe Power of Non-Verbal Cues\n\nNon-verbal communication shapes initial perceptions and improves relationships. Building Trust\n\nConsistent NVC establishes credibility and trust. Agar tum hamesha eye contact aur positive gestures use karte ho, log tum par bharosa karenge\n\nExpressing Confidence\n\nA firm handshake or open stance projects authority. Job interview mein seedha khade hona aur haath milana tumhari self-assurance dikhata hai\n\nEmotional Clarity\n\nNVC conveys subtle emotions beyond words. Muskurahat ya slightly tilted head friendliness aur interest dikhata hai\n\n[Slide 5]\n\nThe Seven Dimensions of Silent Communication\n\nNon-verbal cues are essential in shaping perceptions. Mastering these areas gives you greater control over how you are perceived. Facial Expressions\n\nShow emotions like happiness, sadness, or surprise. A smile conveys warmth, a frown indicates concern. Gestures\n\nHand and arm movements emphasize points. A thumbs-up means approval, pointing directs attention. Posture & Movement\n\nHow we stand and move reveals confidence or tension. Upright posture suggests assurance, slumped shoulders might show nervousness. Eye Contact\n\nShows attention and engagement. Direct eye contact conveys honesty, while avoiding it might signal discomfort. Appearance\n\nClothing, grooming, and style signal professionalism or personality. A sharp suit projects authority, casual attire suggests relaxation. Tone of Voice (Paralanguage)\n\nThe pitch, speed, and volume of speech convey meaning beyond words. A calm tone reassures, a quick pace might show excitement. Touch (Haptics)\n\nPhysical contact like a handshake or a pat on the back. A firm handshake indicates respect, a gentle touch offers comfort. Space (Proxemics)\n\nThe physical distance maintained between people. Close proximity suggests intimacy, while greater distance indicates formality.\n\n[Slide 6]\n\nFocus on the Face: Universal Facial Expressions\n\nFacial expressions are a globally understood way to instantly reveal our emotional state. Surprise\n\nWide eyes, raised brows, and an open mouth signal unexpected events. Joy\n\nA true smile engages both the eyes and mouth, clearly showing happiness. Anger\n\nFurrowed brows, tense lips, and a fixed stare convey strong displeasure.\n\n[Slide 7]\n\nThe Power of Posture and Body Movement\n\nBody language, or Kinesics, reveals our inner state through posture and movement, influencing how we are perceived. Open vs. Closed Posture\n\nOpen posture (uncrossed arms, visible hands) signals receptiveness. Closed posture (crossed arms) suggests defensiveness. The Confidence Indicator\n\nStanding tall with shoulders back projects confidence and authority. A steady stance indicates engagement. Fidgeting & Tension\n\nFidgeting (like tapping feet or playing with hair) often reveals nervousness, anxiety, or boredom.\n\n[Slide 8]\n\nConnecting Through Eye Contact and Tone\n\nEye Contact (Oculesics)\n\nMaintain steady, engaged eye contact to show attentiveness, honesty, and respect. A lack of eye contact can signal disinterest. Tone of Voice (Paralanguage)\n\nYour tone\u2014not just words\u2014conveys emotion and intent. A soft, steady tone shows composure, while varied pitch and volume keep listeners engaged.\n\n[Slide 9]\n\nNon-Verbal Communication in Professional Contexts\n\nIn the workplace, effective non-verbal signals can determine career success. They are especially critical during job interviews, presentations, and team meetings. Project confidence and engagement through upright posture and attentive body language. Engage your audience and project credibility with a confident smile and deliberate gestures. Show active listening and value for colleagues' input through nodding and positive facial expressions. A study found that non-verbal cues account for 55% of the message impact in face-to-face communication.\n\n[Slide 10]\n\nMastering Non-Verbal Communication: Your Lasting Impact\n\nActions Speak Louder Than Words\n\nNon-verbal communication is not just a supplement; it's the foundation of profound influence. By consciously honing your body language, vocal tone, and facial expressions, you unlock unparalleled credibility and connection, creating memorable impressions. Cultivate Awareness\n\nRecognize your own non-verbal habits and accurately interpret others' cues. Achieve Alignment\n\nEnsure perfect harmony between your words and non-verbal cues for authentic and powerful messaging. Maximize Impact\n\nLeverage non-verbal signals strategically to forge positive, lasting impressions in every interaction.\n\n[Slide 11]\n\n[Slide 12]",
